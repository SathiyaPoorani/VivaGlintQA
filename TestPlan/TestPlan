                                               TEST PLAN FOR AUTOMATION TESTING

Project: Viva Glint 
Automation Test Plan Version: 1.0
Objective: To outline the strategy, scope, tools, and processes for automation testing in the Glint project to ensure quality, reduce manual efforts, and increase test coverage and reliability.
 
 SCOPE
 In Scope: Automation testing for key functionalities and modules of the Glint project.
•	Dashboard and Reporting functionalities
•	Report Exports
  Out of Scope: 
•	ODS / Performance / 360 functionalities

OBJECTIVES
•	Automate critical test cases to achieve high test coverage for the Glint platform.
•	Improve efficiency by reducing manual regression testing efforts.
•	Integrate automated tests with CI/CD pipelines for quick feedback on build quality.

TEST STRATEGY
Automation Framework: Utilize a Page object model (POM) framework using Selenium WebDriver with TestNG as the testing framework.
Programming Language: Java
CI/CD Integration: GitHub for continuous integration and development.
Reporting Tool: Extent Reports and TestNG for enhanced reporting and result visualization.

TEST ENVIRONMENT
Operating System: Windows 10, macOS
Browsers: Chrome (latest version), Firefox, Microsoft Edge
Environment Configurations: Viva glint QA environment with test data

TEST DELIVERABLES
•	Automated Test Scripts for Reporting modules in scope.
•	Test Execution Reports
•	Defect Reports from failed test cases.

TEST APPROACH
Test Case Selection: Smoke test cases
Execution Schedule: Automated tests will be executed on Eclipse.
Script Maintenance: Update and maintain scripts as the application evolves to ensure reliability and relevance.

TEST EXECUTION PLAN
Execution Cycles: Smoke test runs and post-build validations.
Trigger Conditions: Tests triggered by new code deployments or scheduled jobs.
Test Reporting: Use reports to track and analyse test coverage, failure trends, and areas requiring manual follow-up.

SCHEDULE
Milestone 1: Initial framework setup and creation of smoke test scripts.
Milestone 2: Automated Smoke test suite coverage for primary flows and implemented POM framework for better maintenance.
Milestone 3: Attached Screenshot and created a report for test results for every testcases.

RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
Risk: Dynamic elements in DOM due to UI changes.
Mitigation: Utilize stable locators and maintain regular script updates.

ENTRY AND EXIT CRITERIA
Entry Criteria: Stable build availability, automated test environment readiness, and finalized test cases.
Exit Criteria: All prioritized automated test cases executed, identified defects logged, and smoke test suite passes within acceptable limits.
